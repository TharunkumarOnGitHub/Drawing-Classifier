# AI-Based Image Classification Game

## About AI and CNNs

**Artificial Intelligence** has innumerable applications and implications in the normal functioning of today’s world. Every discipline of science and field of work invariably depends on artificial computability to drive tasks that take too much effort to be done by humans. Artificial Intelligence powers life in so many different ways; from image classification to recommendation prediction, we are beginning to see AI at play sitting right at home.

One such field of AI is **Deep Learning**, which aims to reach as close as possible to imitate humans in decision making. At the heart of Deep Learning lies the fundamentals of **neural networks**, which can be thought of as imitations of the human nervous system. Neurons in a neural network connected to each other by weighted edges fire differently for different kinds of inputs, just as how different neural pathways are stimulated in our brain for different stimuli. 

Neural networks are the foundation for numerous intelligent algorithms that drive our lives today. From predicting the next movie you would watch to predicting the next product you would buy, neural networks have risen to technological stardom owing to their growing capabilities and increasing ubiquity. One such ability of neural networks, **Convolutional Deep Neural Networks** to be more precise, is **image recognition and classification**. Image classification is a ground-breaking technological phenomenon, as it has led to the development of numerous disciplines outside the domain of computer science and engineering.

Some of the many applications of convolutional neural networks include:

* Image tagging by search engines like Google
* Visual search on search engines
* Face recognition authorizations on smartphones and other purposes
* Medical analysis and prediction of diseases (eg: detection of cancerous growths or predicting the degree of malignancy of a tumorous growth)


## About our Project

Our project aims to create a **entertaining and educational application for all ages**, through which one can **study, experience and understand the power of image classification possible through neural networks**. Our premise is simple - we give you a prompt; you draw it on your screen, and our AI algorithm will predict it for you. As all children are, our model may make mistakes often. However, as is also the case with children, **learning** is an important phase of neural networks where the model **builds upon the information fed to it** and improvises the way it looks at your drawings.

This application is **free to download** from here. We have intentionally made our initiative **open-source** so as to foster a healthy community of budding programmers and computer science explorers. Creating an account and downloading this application onto your system is quite simple. Log right into the application and start gaming!

Read on to know more about this game.

## Perks of having an account

* Free gaming for how much ever time you want - test the limits of our algorithm!
* Free access to downloading the dataset for you to explore with!
* An experience to grow with a community of learners, who wish to tap into the potential of open-source data and applications!
